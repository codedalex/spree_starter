## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Network Connectivity Issues:
We encountered temporary network connectivity issues during setup, but all core components are now configured. When connectivity is restored:

1. Run `bundle install` to complete gem installation
2. Execute database setup commands
3. Run the Azure deployment script

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Gem Installation Fails:
```powershell
# Ensure Ruby is in PATH
$env:PATH += ";C:\Ruby33-x64\bin"
# Try bundle install with fewer concurrent jobs
bundle install --jobs=1 --retry=3
```

#### Database Connection Issues:
```powershell
# Ensure Docker services are running
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
# Check database configuration
rails db:create
```

#### Docker Build Issues:
```powershell
# Use the development docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml up
```
